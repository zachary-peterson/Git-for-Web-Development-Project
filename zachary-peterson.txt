Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
            Inline elements continue on the same line, whereas block elements have a line break.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
            The position of the element stays relative to the parent element, or will just scroll along with the page taking up the same space.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
            Change the margins? I'm a little confused by the question.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
            <header>, <section>, <footer>  <!-- Block elements -->
            <span>, <img>  <!-- Inline by Default  -->
            <div> ??? <!-- Inline/Block  -->
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
            Boxes within boxes, within boxes. Useful in setting up design for a page that's orderly and visually understandable. Creates a flow to the page using elements to group related elements.
            To fix the box model, setting your own widths and heights and how they are displayed on the page rather than the basic inherited sizes. 
            To ensure your elements respect widths, etc. that you've given them you can take into cosideration different screen sizes and set widths for each given sitution. UX Design???
